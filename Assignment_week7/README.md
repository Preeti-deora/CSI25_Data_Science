# ⛽ MPG Prediction Web App

Predict fuel efficiency of a car and explore model insights using an interactive machine learning app built with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Overview

This web application predicts the **Miles Per Gallon (MPG)** of a car based on user-input specifications like horsepower, weight, displacement, and more. It uses a trained **Random Forest Regressor** model and provides insights through various visualizations.
